This is a migration guide for administrators of OpenInfobutton Responder 1.0 who would like to migrate to version 1.1 while
maintaining their existing asset database.

1 - Notes
2 - Database Migration
3 - Building, configuring, and redeploy

Notes
-----

1. The database changes required include adding an AUTO_INCREMENT to the primary key columns of the OIB_ASET and OIB_ASSET_PROPERTY
   columns. This is to faciliate adding new assets and asset properties via the LITE app.

2. This release adds a new REST service endpoint for triggering asset expansion on a particular asset by the LITE
   app. This will require a code rebuild and redeployment of the WAR.


Database Migration
------------------

1. Run the migration script in oib-rbdms-model/migration1011.sql.

Building, configuring, and redeploy
-----------------------------------

1. After retrieving the new branch from the source control repository and running the migration scripts, go to the root
    /oib-rest-responder/ directory (the one directly above the folder this file resides in) and run,

    mvn clean install

    to produce a new WAR in the oib-rest-responder/targets directory.

2. For the new asset expansion web service to function, you must go to the OIB_APP_PROPERTY table and set a valid UTS name
   and password.

3. After rebuilding and running the database migration, you can redeploy the WAR to your existing Tomcat server.
